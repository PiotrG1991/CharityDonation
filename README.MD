The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone
can donate unnecessary items to trusted institutions.

Project assumptions:

The user has things at home that he wants to get rid of, but he doesn't know how.
There are many solutions available, but many of them require extra effort or lack confidence.
You have to go to verified places, but there is no time/no way to go there,
and the containers under the house or local collections are unverified and
it is not known whether these things will actually reach those in need.
